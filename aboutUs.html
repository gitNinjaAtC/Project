          pet paradise is a locally owned and operated pet food and supply
          store. Our mission is to provide dog and cat parents with everything
          that they need to ensure their pet lives a long and happy life. We
          love to talk about pets of all types and we are even more excited when
          you bring your furry family member into the store to meet us! We are
          constantly researching and learning about new products that can make
          our pets lives better. Our goal is to provide a clean, pet friendly
          store that has everything that your dog or cat needs. While our store
          is not very large, we offer an experience that is fast, friendly,
          local, and less expensive that the "Big Box" pet stores. Located in
          Downtown Canal Fulton, Ohio, we look to serve all Dog and Cat owners
          in the surrounding areas by offering a local, low cost alternative to
          the "Big Box" pet stores. We carry over 18 brands of Dog/Cat foods,
          including most major brands. toysWe also have access to many 65 brands
          that are not on our shelves so, if you don't see what you are looking
          for, please ask about special ordering! We also have an extensive
          selection of toys, treats, grooming supplies, supplements and outdoor
          supplies that dog or cat owners may need. Our doors opened for the
          first time on december 23, 2023 and we have been growing ever since.
          Thanks again for visiting our site and learning about our company! We
          will see you soon.
